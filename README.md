# PeerChat
A simple example demonstrated in a meetup in STL.

# TO GET STARTED
 - [Download a Peercoin wallet (Peerunity or Peercoin Core)](http://peercoin.net/wallet) and run it.
 - Move the ppcoin.conf file from this directory to the appropriate directory for your OS.
 ```
    For OSX:  ~/Library/Application Support/PPCoin/
    
    For WINDOWS:  %APPDATA%\PPCoin\
    
    For LINUX: ~/.ppcoin
 ```
 - Please edit the username/password in the ppcoin.conf file to anything (random). Close and re-run Peercoin's Wallet for your configuration changes to take effect.
 - The code is now ready to run! Execute speak.py and listen.py.
 - You can review all available Peercoin RPC commands [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Original_Bitcoin_client/API_calls_list).
 - Note that this is running off Peercoin. To modify it to run off Bitcoin, you will need to change the ports.
